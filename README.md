🛒 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. Customer segmentation is an essential step for businesses to identify different customer groups, target them effectively, and improve marketing strategies.

🚀 Project Overview

Implemented K-Means Clustering algorithm for customer segmentation.

Used features like Annual Income and Spending Score to group customers.

Visualized the clusters to gain business insights.

Helps businesses design personalized marketing strategies.

📂 Dataset

Dataset used: Mall Customers Dataset (commonly available on Kaggle).

Contains customer information such as:

CustomerID

Gender

Age

Annual Income (k$)

Spending Score (1–100)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries Used:

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

📊 Steps Performed

Data Preprocessing

Loaded and cleaned dataset.

Selected relevant features for clustering.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of income, spending score, and age.

Relationship between different features.

Clustering using K-Means

Applied Elbow Method to find optimal number of clusters.

Implemented K-Means with chosen k.

Visualization

Plotted customer clusters in 2D space using annual income & spending score.

Highlighted distinct customer groups.

📈 Results

Customers segmented into 5 clusters (e.g., low income–low spenders, high income–high spenders, etc.).

Businesses can target high-value customers more effectively.
